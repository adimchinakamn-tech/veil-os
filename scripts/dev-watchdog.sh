# Dev-server watchdog v3 — OOM firewall for the 4GB no-swap box.
#
# HISTORY: the box randomly rebooted when idle (whole-machine restart,
# uptime reset to 0). Root cause: next-server RSS drifts toward ~2.7GB
# (V8's default heap ceiling scales with total RAM and never GCs hard
# enough), the box has 3.9GB + ZERO swap, so the kernel OOM-killer
# eventually panics and the sandbox host restarts the container.
#
# v3 fixes the RESTART STORM (2026-10-02 "it keeps restarting permanently"):
#   * COOLDOWN FILE MOVED OUT OF .next/ — the v2 cooldown lived in
#     .next/dev/, which EVERY dev-server boot wipes, so the 15-min cooldown
#     never survived a restart and emergency restarts fired 3-5 minutes
#     apart (log: 21:39 → 21:43 → 21:46 → 21:57). Now it lives in /home/z/
#     and survives every boot.
#   * SELF-DEDUP — earlier rounds left MULTIPLE watchdog instances running
#     with different thresholds (dueling "armed" lines in the log); the
#     newest instance now kills all older copies before arming.
#   * HEAP CAP LOWERED to 1024MB (package.json) so the normal RSS plateau is
#     ~1.55-1.65GB; the planned-restart line sits at 1.75GB, well under the
#     kernel kill zone AND far enough above the plateau that only true leaks
#     trip it.
#
# v4 (2026-10-09 "website should never restart" round): the restart
#   POLICY changed. v3 (and Next.js's own internal watchdog) restarted on
#   process-local metrics alone — but a big RSS with a healthy box is NOT
#   an emergency (heap cap now 1792MB; the live heap alone legitimately
#   reaches ~1.2GB on a fully-warm tree). Restarting a healthy-but-large
#   server was exactly the "website randomly restarts" bug.
#   NEW RULES:
#     * RSS alone NEVER restarts. It logs a rate-limited warning and
#       trusts the heap gardener (v5, instrumentation.ts) to compact.
#     * A planned restart needs BOTH a huge RSS (> 2.3GB) AND real box
#       pressure (MemAvailable < 700MB).
#     * MemAvailable < 320MB alone remains the emergency path (the true
#       OOM firewall — the alternative is a whole-box kernel panic).
#   Cycle tightened 15s → 10s so pressure is caught faster than ever,
#   while the 15-min cooldown still prevents any restart storm.
#
# Protections kept from v2/v3:
#   1. Corroborated RSS guard — planned restart only when the box itself
#                    is running out of memory (RSS high AND MemAvail low).
#   2. MemAvailable guard — if the box drops below ~320MB available,
#                    restart next-server to instantly free ~1.5GB.
#   3. Dedup       — if multiple next-server instances pile up, keep the
#                    :3000 holder and kill the orphans.
#
# Liveness is PORT-BASED (`ss`), not HTTP-latency based. Kills are
# PID-targeted (never name-based pkill — the freetube-service also runs
# `bun run dev`).
#
# Started detached (survives session cleanup):

/**
 * Veil — the AI operator assistant (Updates → Veil AI, owner-unlocked).
 *
 * The owner talks to an assistant that can actually DO things on the live
 * site, exactly like asking a developer for changes:
 *   • post updates to the site feed   → :::action {"type":"post_update",…}
 *   • build & install new site apps   → the Extension Maker HTML format
 *     (installed apps appear in the Arcade's Apps tab)
 *
 * Everything reuses the /api/ai streaming machinery (watchdogs, heartbeat,
 * truncation auto-repair) so app builds are just as resilient here.
 *
 *   POST /api/ai-operator { password, messages, stream? }
 *   → SSE frames {delta} … {done, reply, actions, app}   (stream)
 *   → JSON { reply, actions, app }                        (compat)
 *
 * Actions found in the reply are executed server-side BEFORE the final
 * frame, so the client can refresh the feed / app list the moment the
 * conversation settles.
